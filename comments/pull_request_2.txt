We need a much simpler approach where stats work as normal variables without MonoBehaviour dependency. This will allow stats to be declared as simple fields like `public Stat health = new Stat(100f);` with implicit conversions to float and mathematical operators. Additionally, we should support individual values per entity, drag & drop from the editor, and have a completely generic system that works for any game genre without templates or complex setup.
